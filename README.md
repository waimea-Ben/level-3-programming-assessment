## Project Description


**Language/Tools:** Kotlin, Swing GUI, FlatLaf for styling.\
**Assessment:** NCEA Level 3 Digital Technologies â€“ AS91906

Freaky Ahh House is a Kotlin-based adventure game developed for the NCEA Level 3 programming standard. The game challenges players to navigate through a spooky house, collecting items in order to escape. Designed with a GUI using Java Swing and styled with FlatLaf, it features interactive rooms, item management, movement logic, and text mechanics that guide gameplay.

Players progress through the game by exploring rooms, interacting with objects, and making strategic decisions based on limited information. A key design goal was to balance gameplay with simplicity, making the experience engaging without unnecessary complexity.

**Key Features:**

* Multiple interconnected rooms and a navigable map
* Interactive items that can be picked up and used
* Secret codes and features
* Custom GUI with consistent styling via FlatLaf
* Detailed test plan to verify core functionality

This project demonstrates strong use of object-oriented design, UI programming, and problem-solving under real constraints (e.g. meeting curriculum requirements and assessment deadlines).
